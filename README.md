# Pink Planner - A mobile application for managing events and meetings

Pink Planner is a React application that I developed while enrolled in the Full-stack web development bootcamp (Concordia University). The app has a monthly calendar view, a weekly view, and a day view. The user can read, edit and delete his calendar events. Events are stored on a MongoDB database.

The technologies used include: HTML, CSS, Styled Components, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, RESTfull API, MongoDB.

### Calendar, week and day views

- **Month**: Displays all events of the current month (title only), with the ability to change months and years.
- **Week**: Displays all events of the current week (title and time), with the ability to change weeks.
- **Day**: Displays all events of the current day (all details), with the ability to change the date, and to edit and delete any event.
- A "add new event" button is always visible.
