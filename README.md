# Pink Planner - A mobile application for managing events and meetings

Pink Planner is a React application that I developed while enrolled in the Full-stack web development bootcamp (Concordia University). The app has a monthly calendar view, a weekly view, and a day view. The user can read, edit and delete his calendar events. Events are stored on a MongoDB database.

The technologies used include: HTML, CSS, Styled Components, React, Node, Express, RESTfull API, MongoDB.

## Project Status

As there are endless possibilities to expand this project, I am still working on implementing new features (as of 14/04/2021) and optimizing the application.
